Week 1 of "Python Data Visualization"

Question 1
It is important to learn how to read and search through the Python documentation. The answers to all of the questions in this quiz can be found within the official Python 3 documentation.

What module provides support for arithmetic on rational numbers?
Just give the name of the module (such as random) with no spaces.
- fractions

Question 2
What function could you use to create a complete copy of a nested dictionary (a dictionary that has dictionaries as values)?

If you think the answer is a builtin function just give the function name (such as int) with no spaces, parentheses, or arguments.
If you think the answer is a function contained within a module, give the answer in the form module.function with no other spaces, parentheses, or arguments.
- copy.deepcopy

Question 3
What function would you use to open a web page in a new browser window from a Python program?

If you think the answer is a builtin function just give the function name (such as int) with no spaces, parentheses, or arguments.
If you think the answer is a function contained within a module, give the answer in the form module.function with no other spaces, parentheses, or arguments.
(If there are multiple functions that you could use, give only one.)
- webbrowser.open

Question 4
What Python module allows you to read and write WAV audio files?
Just give the name of the module (such as random) with no spaces.
- wave

Question 5
What is the pickle module?
- A module that allows you to convert Python objects into a byte stream and back. The "pickled" byte stream is suitable to be stored on disk or transferred over the network.

Question 6
Which Python data types are immutable?
- frozenset
- float
- bytes
- tuple
- string

Question 7
How do you open a file over the network at a specified URL?
Just give the name of the function (including any module name(s) with periods) with no spaces, parentheses, or arguments.
