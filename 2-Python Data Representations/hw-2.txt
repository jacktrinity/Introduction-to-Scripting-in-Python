Question 1
Which of the following expressions  evaluates to the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]?
- list(range(0, 5, 1))  
- list(range(0, 5))  

Question 2
Let my_list be the list ["This", "course", "is", "great"].

What is len(my_list)?
What non-negative number is the index of "great"? I.e., how would you replace the question marks in my_list[???] so that the resulting value is "great"?
- 4 3

Question 3
If we want to split a list my_list into two halves, which of the following uses slices to do so correctly?

More precisely, if the length of my_list is 2n, i.e., even, then the two parts should each have length n. If its length is 2n+1, i.e., odd, then the two parts should have lengths n and n+1.
- my_list[0 : len(my_list) // 2] and my_list[len(my_list) // 2 : len(my_list)]
- my_list[: len(my_list) // 2] and my_list[len(my_list) // 2 :]

Question 4
If n and m are non-negative integers, consider the list final_list computed by the code snippet below.

init_list = list(range(1, n))
final_list = init_list * m
- (n - 1) Ã— m

Question 5
If nn is a non-negative integer, consider the list split_list computed by the code snippet below.

test_string = "xxx" + " " * n + "xxx"
split_list = test_string.split(" ")

The length of this list depends on the particular values of nn used in computation. Which option below correctly expresses the length of split_list in terms of n?
- n + 1
